Multiplicative error will cancel out. However, for additive errors, the enduring error when the visual score is recovered will lead to more observations at (v, s)=(0, +s) without equivalents at (v, s)=(+v, 0) to balance them out since the symptoms have a lower bound (see thick vertical line on the left of the graph of visual vs symptom)."
