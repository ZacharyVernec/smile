    "Reasoning: The relationship is linear, no persons are discarded from the population, each person will have at least two points to describe their straight line. Multiplicative error will cancel out. However, for additive errors, the enduring error when the visual score is recovered will lead to more observations at (v, s)=(0, +s) without equivalents at (v, s)=(+v, 0) to balance them out (see thick vertical line on the left of the graph of visual vs symptom)."
