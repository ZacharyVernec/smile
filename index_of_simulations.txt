_large.rar : original sim, all populations and regressions, regression objects include copy of populations
tests_for_daytype : to compare with _large.rar to see differences when daytype is changed
tests_for_scoretype : similar to tests_for_daytype
saved_populations & saved_regressions : similar to _large.rar but scoretype is float32, regression doesn't include copy of populations
""_2 : populations now include persons id
""_3 : sampler2 now has triggered_by_equal=False
""_4 : filter now has treshold 40% (was 70%)
""_5 : filter now only checks on day=7 (used to do *any* day before day=7)
""_6 : samplers 1 and 2 have triggered_by_equal=True, and sampler 3 has threshold 2 (was 6)
""_7 : smile sampler now checks for multiple days in a row, here 2 days
""_6_2 : _6 is incorrect as the threshold was still left at 6. Here it is set to 2, as it should have been.
""_8 : sampler only checks current and future days for already_sampled (back to checking for 1 day in a row)
""_9 : sampler and methodologies refactored and fixed some logic about cross-sampler interactions, removed limits
""_10 : added limit->clip at LASTVISIT ie day 159
