_large.rar : original sim, all populations and regressions, regression objects include copy of populations
tests_for_daytype : to compare with _large.rar to see differences when daytype is changed
tests_for_scoretype : similar to tests_for_daytype
saved_populations & saved_regressions : similar to _large.rar but scoretype is float32, regression doesn't include copy of populations
""_2 : populations now include persons id
""_3 : sampler2 now has triggered_by_equal=False
""_4 : filter now has treshold 40% (was 70%)
""_5 : filter now only checks on day=7 (used to do *any* day before day=7)
